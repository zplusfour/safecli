# SafeInput

This is a simple CLI written in Go (best lang), to help you get the title of a page before you get into the page.

## Usage

fork the repo, and type in the terminal:

```sh
$ safe <url>
```

for example:

```sh
$ safe https://github.com # GitHub: Where the world builds software Â· GitHub
```

Cool! right?
